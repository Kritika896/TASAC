# Chemical Reactor Temperature Control with TASAC Reinforcement Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements a reinforcement learning approach for controlling the temperature of a batch chemical reactor. Using a **Twin Actor Soft Actor-Critic (TASAC)** architecture, the system learns to follow temperature trajectories by manipulating coolant flow rates â€” crucial for ensuring product quality and process safety in chemical manufacturing.

## Background
Temperature control in batch reactors presents significant challenges due to the **nonlinear dynamics**, **exothermic reactions**, and **time-varying behavior** of chemical processes. Traditional PID controllers often struggle with these complexities, especially when following specific temperature trajectories. This project demonstrates how **reinforcement learning** can address these challenges by learning optimal control policies directly from process data.
